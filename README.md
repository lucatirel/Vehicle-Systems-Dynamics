# Vehicle-Systems-Dynamics
This repository contains the code for the project of the Vehicle Systems Dynamics exam. It includes the nonlinear modelling and control of a co-axial tilting rotor tricopter UAV, using an hybrid backstepping sliding-mode hierarchical control scheme and estimation by EKF and UKF. Finally a linear Kalman Filter was implemented on the trimmed model.
